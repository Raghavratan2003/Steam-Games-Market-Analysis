## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of Steam games to explore:

- Game pricing trends over time  
- The rise of free-to-play titles  
- Genre-wise distribution and performance  
- Correlation between price and positive ratings  
- Insights into undervalued game genres

The dataset was cleaned, processed, and visualized using only **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, focusing on building meaningful plots and data stories without machine learning.

## 🔍 Analysis Questions Solved

This project answers 15+ real-world data questions using visual and statistical methods:

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
1. Convert `release_date` to datetime and drop invalid entries  
2. Convert `price` to numeric and handle free/NaN values  
3. Create a new column `release_year` for year-wise trend analysis  
4. Split and process multi-genre values using `explode()`

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
5. What is the distribution of game prices?  
6. How many games were released each year?  
7. What percentage of games are free vs paid?  
8. Which 10 genres have the most games?  
9. What are the top 10 genres by average price?  
10. What is the relationship between price and positive ratings?  
11. What are the correlations between price, positive ratings, and negative ratings?

### 📈 Advanced Insights
12. Which genres are *undervalued* (i.e., high-rated but low-priced)?  
13. Has the average price of games increased or decreased over time?  
14. How has the number of free vs paid games changed year over year?
